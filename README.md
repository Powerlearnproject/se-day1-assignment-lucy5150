Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles,methods and tools to develop and maintain high quality software systems.It plays a crucial role in technology industry by enabling tthe creation of software applications and various aspects that power variousaspects of modern life inluding communication,commerce,entertainment and healthcare.
Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Development of programming languages-the first high level language to have an associated complier was created in 1951 and it was FORTRAN that is FORmula TRANslation.Establishment of software engineering as a discipline obtained software that is realiable and works perfectly on machines.
Emergence ofobject-oriented programming gained traction with languages like C++ and smalltalk.This paradigm shift improved code reusability and made software maintenance easy.
Agile methodologies;The agile Manifesto was introduced in 2001,promoting iterative development,collaboration and adapting to change over following strict plans.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements;Gathering and documentinguser needs and system requireents.
Design;Creating high level and detailed designs of the software architectureand user interface .
Implementation ;writing code and building the software according to design specifications.
Testing;conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standardsand functional requirements.
Deployment;realising software to users to users or customers.
Maintenance;providing ongoing support,updates,and enhancements to the software after deployment.
Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall is sequential approach with distinct phases flowing downwards like a waterfall while Agile methodologies provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer;responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions. 
Quality Assurance Engineer;ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
Project Manager ;oversees the planning ,execution ,and delivery of software projects.
Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Intergrated Development Environment;software suites that  provide  tools for writing ,debugging,and testing code;examples visual studio,eclipse.Version Control systems ;software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members examples ,Git,subversion

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges. 
Tight deadlines.Changing requirements.Techinical debt.
strategies for overcoming;effective communication ,agile methodologies,priotization of tasks
Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing;testing individuals components or modules of software.
Integration testing;testing interactions between different components or sub systems.
System testing;testing the entire software system as awhole.
Acceptance testing;testing the software against user requirementsto ensure it meets user needs.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Propt engineering-is all about crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models.Propt engineering helps in making your questions clear and specific so theAI understands what you need.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
vague prompt'tell me about guy who invented the bulb'More effective'provide details aboutThomas Eison'
